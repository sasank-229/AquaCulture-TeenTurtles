            In India, Aquaculture has boomed in Andhra Pradesh in recent decades. <b>AP stands as 1st with 33,49,560 tonnes in Fish Production</b>, followed by West Bengal with 17,42,090 tonnes in 2nd and Gujarat with 8,34,530 tonnes in 3rd. The Indian government established the first aquaculture ponds in this area in the 1970s around Lake Kolleru. Since then, the initial success of those projects has made aquaculture an appealing and profitable choice for many farmers in the region who regularly dealt with crops being flooded, the intrusion of salt into water used for irrigation, and Bay of Bengal cyclones. <b>Andhra Pradesh accounts for about 70 percent of India's shrimp production</b>.
            <p>The contribution of the State in the country's overall exports was 23.66% in quantity and 34.76% in terms of value, the Joint Director said. "In 2020-21, India had exported 11,49,510 metric tonnes of seafood worth Rs 43,720 crore ($5,956 million). In 2021-22, marine products of about 13,69,264 metric tonnes, valued at Rs 57,586 crore ($7.76 billion) were shipped," Mr. Jeyabal told The Hindu on Wednesday.According to overseas shipment data, the US continued to be the major importer of Indian seafood, followed by China, the European Union, South-east Asia and Japan as the other major customers."From Andhra Pradesh, frozen shrimp, frozen fish, squid, cuttlefish, dried items and other varieties were exported," the JD said.</p>
            <p>The Visakhapatnam port hit the Highest Exporting Shipment over the India with a scale of 2,16,457 metric tonnes, followed by Kolkata (1,16,419 MT), Kochi (1,43,552), Krishnapatnam (64,230 MT), Kakinada Port (8,968 MT) during the 2020-21 fiscal year.</p>
