            <p>The Oxygen Levels are the main parameter for the culture. Since without the oxygen
                no living being can survive. For the aquatic species they get the Dissolved Oxygen
                from the water.
                For that purpose we will have some of the techiniques like growing the Phytoplankton
                and Zooplankton in natural way.
                For techincal purposes we will have the dissolved Oxygen Tablets and the Airators.
                The Airators are the techincal machines used for dissolved oxygen.
                There are atleast 2000-3000 Airators per Acre.
                <ul>
                    <li>For Shrimp the oxygen levels are 4-5 ppm and above.</li>
                    <li>For Fish 4-5ppm and above.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>A 0.5-1.0 ha pond would require, four aerators installed at the corners of the pond, approximately 3-5 m from the bottom of the dike and positioned at an angle that will encourage the maximum water flow within the pond. The type of aerator to be used depends on the depth of the water. One horsepower paddle wheel aerators should be used in ponds of less than 1.2 m water depth and the 2 HP (horsepower) paddle wheel aerators should be used in ponds deeper than 1.2 m. The most popular type of aerator is the long arm paddle wheel aerator, which is driven by a 2-10 HP electric, or diesel motor mounted on the dike. The aerators should be switched-on 24 hrs before the PL are stocked to allow enough time to create the current and clean up the feeding area.</p>
