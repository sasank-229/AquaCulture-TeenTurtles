            <h2>Pond Preparation</h2>
            <p>Before a pond can be stocked for a new crop, the excessive wastes, which accumulate in the pond during the previous crop, must be removed and the soil and water conditioned. Growing of shrimp in an improperly prepared pond may lead to difficulty in pond management during the culture period, which could result in a decrease in production capacity of the pond.</p>
            <h2>Pond Cleaning</h2>
            <p>
                The cleaning of a pond or removal of the wastes, especially the organic and phosphatic wastes that have accumulated in the pond bottom could be, accomplished by drying, liming and ploughing. However, these methods could still leave an adverse effect on the water and soil quality in the pond, which could result in a decrease in the production capacity of the pond.
            </p>
            <p>There are two methods to Clean the Pond, they are: </p>
            <dt>
                <dl><h3>Dry Method</h3></dl>
                <dd>This method is used when the pond bottom can be dried completely. The pond is drained and left to dry in the sun for a period of 10-30 days. Then the waste is removed, either manually or mechanically, and transported to the waste dumping area. Removal of waste by machines has an advantage that it can compact the bottom soil. However, this cleaning method by drying may lead to development of acidity, lowering the level of the pond bottom and the diffusion of wastes if the workers are inexperienced.</dd>
                <dl><h3>Wet Method</h3></dl>
                <dd>In areas where the pond cannot be dried completely, pressure washing can be used to flush out the wastes. This method takes a shorter time and is more efficient than the dry method. Flushing should be continued until the acid and dark anaerobic layer in the soil are removed. This method is suitable in the acid sulfate areas where the oxidation of the soil must be avoided. However, the method requires a sedimentation pond to all settlement of the suspended wastes to avoid contaminating the drainage canal and the natural environment. The remaining pathogens in the ponds can be eliminated during the liming process.</dd>

                    <h3>Wet Cleaning</h3>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Once the pond is cleaned, it is then filled with water and left overnight before flushing out to remove debris and elevate the pH. This process should be repeated until the pH of the water remains above 7, and only then the lime is applied.</p>
            <p>The lime requirement of a pond depends on the soil pH. The measurement of the soil pH should be determined either by the wet soil method or by the dry soil method. During the application, lime should be spread throughout the pond bottom and up to the top of the dike. A large portion of lime should be applied over the feeding areas and to all parts of the pond that have remained wet. When the pond is properly limed and filled with water, the average water pH should be between 7.5-8.5 with daily fluctuation of less than 0.5. Agricultural lime, dolomite or hydrated lime at 100 kg/ha/day should be added to maintain the required pH.
