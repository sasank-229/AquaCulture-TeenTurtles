                A Pond Liner is an impermeable geo-membrane used for retention of liquids, including the lining of reservoirs, retention basins, hazardous and nonhazardous surface impoundments, garden ponds and artificial streams in parks and gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pond liners need to be protected from sharp objects (for example, stones) below the liner and from being punctured by any objects in the water body. Protection can be provided with layers of sand, geotextiles (particularly needle-punched nonwovens) and other materials. Pond liners are manufactured in rolls or accordion-folded on pallets. When deployed in the field their edges and ends are overlapped and seamed together. Methods are thermal fusion, solvents, adhesives and tapes.

            <p><b>Bird netting or anti-bird netting</b> is a form of bird pest control. It is a net used to prevent birds from reaching certain areas.</p>
            <p>Bird protection netting comes in a variety of shapes and forms, The most common is a small mesh (1 or 2 cm squares) either extruded and bi-oriented polypropylene or woven polyethylene.</p>
            <p>Bird netting may be used to protect fisheries and fish wildlife reserves from predator birds. Also in aquaculture, Aqua Farmers need to protect their work and fish crops from marauding birds. These type of birds have usually a larger wing span (seagulls, pelicans, herons, cormorants etc.) and a larger mesh size (with individual strands being more resistant as it will be installed on a cable system crossing the growing ponds). These netting are usually white as to be very visible for the large sea birds will be deterred by the sight of a barrier to their diving into the ponds.
